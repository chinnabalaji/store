system release plan:
12.1 Testing plan:
After developing the complete product , tests will be performed.in  a group few people perform the tests required for the detection of the bugs and ensure efficiency of the product. The tester of the product is the developer of the software. For a formal process a separate testing group within the development team is used.
Testing is carried out in a three levels of granularity.:
1, unit testing:
Where individual program units or object classes are tested.it focuses on the functionality of objects or methods.
2, Component testing:
It is used to focus on testing component interfaces. Where several individual units are integrated into a composite component
3, system testing
 where some or all the components in a system are integrated and the system is tested on a whole.
Development testing is primarily a defect testing process, where the aim of the testing is to discover bugs in the software.it is therefore usually interleaved with debugging the process of locating the problems with the code.
12.2 Packaging plan:
A compressed tar.gz file is provided to the user consisting all the source code, library files and related documents. The details of the release plan are given
